It was something I’ve always wanted to do. I learned a whole lot about physically based rendering, for obvious reasons. But I also learned a lot about coding in CUDA and its in’s and out’s, which involved writing a lot of pure C code and writing nifty inline structs and functions for both host and device uses.</p>\n<p>Although, the renderer doesn’t have fancy features, I’m quite happy with it. Despite the lack of acceleration structures, it still runs at ~20fps, and converges around 30 seconds, on my laptop. The next area of improvement would definitely be adding a kd-tree, in order to support larger scenes.</p>\n<p>Finally, as usual, I decided to make things interesting by making it interactive. Being able to easily modify the scene on the fly really makes it more fun and creates lots of interesting images.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interactive real-time path tracer in CUDA</li>\n<li>Advanced Rendering Seminar</li>\n<li>University of Pennsylvania, Spring 2013</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"CUDA Path Tracer","date":"July 25, 2013"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/2013-07-25-cuda-path-tracer","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2013-05-16-webtube","type":"post"},"frontmatter":{"title":"WebTube"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2013-10-25-mac-the-windows-way","type":"post"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mac, the Windows Way"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
