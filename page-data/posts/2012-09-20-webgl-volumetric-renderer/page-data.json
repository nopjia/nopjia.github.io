The idea is to ray cast a 3D texture, which should be very fast since OpenGL texture lookups are highly optimized; however, this is not doable since 3D textures are not allowed in WebGL.</p>\n<p>During SIGGRAPH 2012, I met Luis Kabongo from VICOMTech, who showed me their <a href=\"http://demos.vicomtech.org/volren/\">implementation</a> of a WebGL volume renderer, which they use for medical imaging. They made it possible by, instead of using a 3D texture, using a 2D texture atlas, which is made up of 2D texture slices. This is a very simple solution. I immediate took this idea and implemented my own version.</p>\n<p>VICOMTechâ€™s volume renderer is for simply viewing 3D datasets, so they implemented it using alpha compositing with no lighting.</p>\n<p>I took it a step further for my own renderer and implemented physically-based volume rendering. The lighting model is based on light transmittance. I introduced multiple lights into the scene and use exponential fall-off to calculate transmittance.</p>\n<p>As a result, the renderer features physically-based lighting, volumetric shadows, and support for multiple lights. The results turned out very nicely.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"WebGL Volumetric Renderer","date":"September 20, 2012"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/2012-09-20-webgl-volumetric-renderer","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2013-05-16-webtube","type":"post"},"frontmatter":{"title":"WebTube"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
