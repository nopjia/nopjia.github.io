Their first major break was actually back in Shang-Chi. However, their role in that movie was barely visible. (Andy played the painted-mask Death Dealer!)</p>\n<p>Then came the amazing Everywhere movie. The tone, the absurdity, the nonsensical fight scenes‚Äîthis movie was so made for them. And oh they shone.</p>\n<p>The thing is, Andy wasn‚Äôt traditionally trained in kung fu. He was simply a die-hard kung fu fan who taught himself through hours of kung fu flicks. As a result, he developed a unique non-traditional goofy comical style based on TV and movies. Admittedly, it‚Äôs heavily inspired by his hero, Jackie Chan, but he pushed it even further to an almost childlike playful quality.</p>\n<p>From YouTube to Hollywood, by sticking to your guns and passion.
