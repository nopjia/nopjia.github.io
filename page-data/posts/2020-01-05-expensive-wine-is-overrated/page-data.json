I would buy $50, $80, $100 bottle wines, cases of them. (One time I bought a $300 bottle wine and even received a certificate for it!)</p>\n<p>Then as part of my 2017 New Year’s resolution, I audited my budget and realized I’ve spent a stupid amount of money on wine. Since then I slowly fell out of my “blind love” for wine and started to see it for what it is.</p>\n<p>This video reflects a lot of my recent feelings toward wine. Don’t get me wrong, I still love wine, but you really don’t need to spend $100 a bottle to have a good time. Everything in moderation. 😅🍷</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Expensive wine is overrated","date":"January 05, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/2020-01-05-expensive-wine-is-overrated","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2019-11-11-minimalism","type":"post"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Minimalism"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-09-24-hades","type":"post"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hades"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
