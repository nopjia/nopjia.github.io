Now I’ve rebuilt it from the ground up with <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a> and a powerful site generator <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">Gatsby</a>.</p>\n<p>It took me a good while (a month or so) to finally complete this project, as I was learning a lot of new libraries along the way. I was also being a smartypants and jumped ahead to Gatsby v2, which is still in beta. I ended up writing and rewriting a lot of throwaway code as the beta still had a ton of moving parts and bugs. However, the Gatsby community is very active and has been very helpful in helping me get through the blockers. Thanks guys!</p>\n<p>I will probably be writing more about the development process later.
